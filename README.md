# CoroutineAsyncTestApp
 
A mutimodule app that uses coroutines and async in action. During coroutine's work there's an option to cancel the job and it has timeout of 1 second, the calculation will stop and it shows an alert dialog. 

To demonstrate this functionality I use delay, otherwise the change in button's text is unnoticable and you can't reach timeout.
